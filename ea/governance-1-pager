# Architecture Governance Forum  
**Terms of Reference (Draft)**

## Purpose
The Architecture Governance Forum provides a supportive environment for architects and designers across the program to collaborate, review, and guide technical decisions. Our goal is to uplift design quality, ensure consistency, and foster collective ownership of the architecture.

## Objectives
- Promote consistent, high-quality architecture practices across the program.
- Encourage early collaboration on designs to identify opportunities and risks.
- Review significant design decisions, sharing constructive feedback and guidance.
- Maintain alignment to agreed principles, standards, and strategic direction.
- Identify and escalate architecture risks or cross-team impacts early.

## Scope
- Solution designs, technical patterns, key integrations, infrastructure blueprints.
- Governance of architectural principles and adherence to best practices.
- Sharing of lessons learned and emerging technologies across teams.

## Ways of Working
- Meet [weekly/fortnightly] for 60 minutes.
- Open, respectful, and collaborative discussions â€” no "blame culture."
- Design authors present briefly (5-10 mins) followed by open questions and feedback.
- Focus on improving the design, not critiquing the individual.
- Actions are recorded, owners assigned, and followed up next session if needed.

## Membership
- Lead Architect (Chair)
- Solution Architects
- Domain/Platform Architects
- Lead Engineers (invited based on topic)

Participation from relevant stakeholders (e.g., Business Analysts, Product Owners) encouraged where appropriate.

## Guiding Principles
- **Constructive Collaboration:** Every review is an opportunity to improve together.
- **Pragmatic Discipline:** Balance ideal standards with delivery realities.
- **Shared Ownership:** Architecture is a team sport, not an individual activity.
- **Continuous Learning:** Capture and share learnings to improve future designs.

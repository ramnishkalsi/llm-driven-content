Okay, let's boost the protein in that delicious slow cooker soup! Here are a few ways you can easily make it more protein-rich, incorporating ingredients that would work well with the flavors we already have:
Option 1: Adding Chickpeas or Lentils
These are fantastic plant-based protein sources that will soak up the flavorful broth beautifully.
Updated Recipe: Spicy Coconut Vegetable Soup with Chickpeas/Lentils
Follow the original recipe, and add one of the following:
	•	For Chickpeas: 1 (15-ounce) can of chickpeas, rinsed and drained. Add them in the last hour of cooking to warm through.
	•	For Lentils: 1 cup of red or brown lentils, rinsed. Add them along with the other vegetables at the beginning of the cooking process. Red lentils will break down more and create a thicker consistency, while brown lentils will hold their shape better.
Why this works: Chickpeas and lentils are mild in flavor and will complement the coconut, harissa, and vegetables without overpowering them. They add a satisfying heartiness to the soup.
Option 2: Adding Cooked Chicken or Tofu
If you have cooked chicken or tofu on hand, this is a quick and easy way to add protein.
Updated Recipe: Spicy Coconut Vegetable Soup with Chicken/Tofu
Follow the original recipe, and add one of the following in the last 30-60 minutes of cooking:
	•	Cooked Chicken: 2-3 cups of shredded or cubed cooked chicken (rotisserie chicken works great!).
	•	Cooked Tofu: 1 block (about 14 ounces) of firm or extra-firm tofu, pressed and cubed. You can pan-fry or bake the tofu beforehand for a firmer texture, or add it directly to the slow cooker.
Why this works: Chicken is a versatile protein that pairs well with the spices and coconut. Tofu will absorb the flavors of the broth and provide a plant-based protein boost.
Option 3: Adding Edamame
For a vibrant green and protein-packed addition, edamame is a great choice.
Updated Recipe: Spicy Coconut Vegetable Soup with Edamame
Follow the original recipe, and add 1-2 cups of shelled edamame during the last 15-20 minutes of cooking.
Why this works: Edamame adds a slightly sweet and nutty flavor that complements the other ingredients. It also provides a good source of fiber.
Which option should you choose?
	•	If you're looking for a vegetarian/vegan option, chickpeas or lentils are excellent choices.
	•	If you have leftover cooked chicken, that's a super convenient way to add protein.
	•	Tofu is a great plant-based option that will soak up the flavors.
	•	Edamame adds a nice pop of color and a different texture.
No matter which option you choose, adding a protein source will make your delicious soup even more satisfying and nutritious! Let me know if you'd like any more details on a specific option.

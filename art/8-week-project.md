# Single Large Flower Painting Plan - 8 Weekly Sessions

Here's a plan to create a stunning large detailed flower painting over your 2-month period with one hour sessions each week:

## Week 1: Research & Sketching

- Select your favorite composition
- Prepare your canvas/paper and gather supplies

## Week 2: Detailed Drawing
- Transfer your chosen sketch to your final surface
- Focus on accurate proportions and placement
- Draw all the important details (petals, center, subtle curves)
- Consider the lighting direction for later shading

## Week 3: Background & Base Layers
- Apply a light wash or base color to your background
- Block in the main color areas of your flower
- Keep these initial layers fairly simple and light
- Focus on establishing the overall color scheme

## Week 4: Building Depth

## Week 6: Fine Details

- Refine the center with precise detailing
- Begin harmonizing all elements together

## Week 7: Highlights & Refinement
